Please leave any suggestions to improve or bugs on my blog : [Ada Blogs Status](http://adadaa.net/1uthavi/ada-blogs-sites-status/)

== Installation ==

WordPress automatic installation is fully supported and recommended.

If you place files in your mu-plugins directory, the widget is active and available to all blogs.

If you place files in your plugins directory, the widget needs activation by a blog admin. Only after activation, the widget is available.

You should see Ada Blogs Status widget in Widget section.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Should I have to show all 3 tabs? =

No, you can show/sort only the tabs you wanted to show.  In the widget option, set it to 'None' to hide a particular tab.


= How does the Avatar work? =

It does not depend on any other Avatar plugins.  It just takes the first Admin of the site/blog's avatar.

= Easy way to style? =

There is a style file ./css/default.css.  Use that to style.

= I don't want this one widget with all 3 tabs.  I want single widget per status =

There is a deprecated version of the plugin with 3 seperate widgets available at [Ada List All](http://adadaa.net/1uthavi/new-updated-active-blogs-widgets/)
